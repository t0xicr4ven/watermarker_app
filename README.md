# Watermarker
___

This application will allow you to add a watermark to selected images.

Choose image from a file it will add the watermark and show you a preview.

Will then ask where you want to save the new image and what to name it.

Very rough version right now, could add radio buttons to ask user where to add the watermark, ie Top left, Bottom right. Also could add option to add text as the watermark or select a different image, currently can only use the image i have added.


## Requirments
* Tkinter
* pillow
